## LED Module A2
Like module A, this is a replacement board for a Steinel Lamp enclosure. Differences to Module A:
 - Standard PCB instead of aluminum
 - Two layers instead of one
 - Wider traces, no more squeezing below resistors
 - Through-Hole connector
 - Alternative temperature sensor / EEPROM
 - UV LED channel

This has not been assigned the name "A2" instead of an increased version number for "A", because
the single-layer aluminum process might still have advantages and evolve.
