## LED Module A
This is the first LED board to test the Main Module. It fits nicely into the enclosure of some lamps by German manufacturer Steinel, but is not compatible with any of the existing electronics therein. So this is not a feasible replacement or upgrade - it was just conveinient for me to have a ready-made enclosure.

This iteration of the design is a single layer PCB, to be manufacuted with an aluminum core. Adding though-holes into an aluminum PCB is very costly, so I made some effort to route all the LEDs series on the front layer.

See [Module A2](../LED_Module_A2) for a variant with two layers and updated temperature sensor / memory chip.

I will soon compare the thermal properties of the Aluminum version (A) and the FR4 version (A2) of the board.

### Cost
*(This estimation is outdated. I will update this with real-live prices soon.)*

Assuming 200 pieces of these boards, sourcing components from Mouser, and 1 € == 1 USD:

- LEDs: 14.18 €
- Other components: ca. 2.00 €
- Aluminum PCB 1.52 USD
- PCB assembly 2.44 USD

Sum: 20.14 € or USD

For much lower quantities and/or sourcing components via the PCB manufacturer, prices may be three times higher.
