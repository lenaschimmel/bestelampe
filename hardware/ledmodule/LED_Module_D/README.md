## LED Module D
### DO NOT USE
This module is flawed in countless ways, and I really recommend to not use it in any way. Not as it is, not as a basis for modification.

I just uploaded it for transparency, because I talk a lot about it on the [Progress](https://github.com/lenaschimmel/bestelampe/wiki/Progress) page. You can read about it's problems there.

### Goal
This board should make it possible to have up to 10 high power LEDs with different colors aranged in a slim (2mm) and short (20mm) line. A TLC59711 is used to generate the 10 PWM signals, but it is not driving the LEDs directly. Instead, a line driver, MOSFETs and series resistors are used to power the LEDs without the complexities of a constant current drive.
