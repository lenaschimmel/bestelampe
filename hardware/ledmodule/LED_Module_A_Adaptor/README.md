## LED Module A Adaptor
This adaptor serves three purposes
 - Make the LED Module A v1.0 fit into a Steinel Enclosure, see #2
 - Allow to use the LED Module A v1.0 on future versions of the Main Board which will have a different pin assignment
 - Allow to use future versions of the LED boards with the old version of the Main Board

Documentation on how to select the function will follow soon...
