## Hardware components
 - Hardware
   - **[Main Modules](/hardware/mainmodule/)** • Control board with power supply, micro controller, 6-channel PWM (pulse width modulation) dimmer and many ports.
   - **Extension Modules** • Additional simultaneous wireless protocols, 16 additional PWM channels. Not started yet.
   - **LED Modules** • Stuff that actually emits light. Current focus of hardware development, which might have large impact on the future development of the Main Module as well.
   - **Enclosure** • To hold the electronics together, protect it from the environment, and guide the light.
   - **Reflectors** • Some experiments with 3d-printed reflectors.
