_See the [README one level above](../README.md) for general info about Driver Modules_

## Driver Module X (Template)
This should be the template for future driver boards, and Driver Board A is actually based on this one.

But I think this template might be scrapped soon, and I should make a new one based on Driver Board A.

Also, the space was already very tight for Driver Board A, so that other driver boards might need a bigger PCB anyway.
