## Round lamp enclosure
This is a prototype of a round, wall-mounted lamp enclosure, based on a cheap transparent flower pot I found at the local hardware store.

It's intended for an *extended setup* (see [the "Price" section in the main readme](/README.md#price)), so it will have four groups of six color channels. That makes it possible to control the brightness and color for each direction separately. The current iteration prioritizes the diffusor for very smooth transitions between the four sections, and the light emission is undirected.

Instead of LED modules with custom PCBs, I'm using short LED strips which can be bent in one dimension only.

There is also a short ring of addressable LEDs that illuminate the front plate. You can insert a mask here to display e.g. a house number, short word or small graphic, and tint it in colorful animated gradients.

**Everything in this directory is very messy and work in progress - you are not (yet) suppose to understand the files and how to assemble this lamp.**
