## ABL LED Heatplate
This PCB is a tool to facilitate soldering the [LED Module E](../LED_Module_E/). On an internal layer, it has three long resistive traces that can heat up three areas of the top side. A regular heatplate can't be used because of the central "Dual Row Inverted Thru Board Card Edge Connector".

The resistence, recommended voltage and power of this heatplate are currently unknown. I expect this to be working with 5V, but I'll have to measure once it arrives.

I will add recommendations for assembly as well.
