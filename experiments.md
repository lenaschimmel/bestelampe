# Outdated information about early experiments
_Initially this repository contained a lot of different approaches to build the lamp, many of which are no longer revelevant. The following texts were moved from the main README of the repository._

## Parts and Modules
The besteLampe! project has multiple parts. In the future, they might be moved into separate repositories. They are:

 - Hardware
   - ðŸŸ¢ **[Main module](hardware/mainmodule/)** â€¢ Control board with power supply, micro controller, 6-channel PWM (pulse width modulation) dimmer and many ports. *First version shipped and tested*
   - ðŸ”´ **Extension module** â€¢ Additional simultaneous wireless protocols, 16 additional PWM channels.
   - ðŸŸ¢ **LED modules** â€¢ Stuff that actually emits light. *only handmade prototypes*
   - ðŸŸ¡ **Enclosure** â€¢ To hold the electronics together, protect it from the environment, and guide the light.
 - Software
   - ðŸŸ¢  **[Firmware](software/bestelampe) for main- and extension module**
   - ðŸŸ¡ **Control software (Web, Desktop, Mobile, CLI, M5Paper...)**
   - ðŸ”´ **Common code library** â€¢ The firmware and all control software variants are written in Rust and should all use a common, portable code base.

In the initial concept, hardware modules are intended like to be used like this:

<img src="assets/modules.drawio.png" width="49%" />

- The main module with its ESP32-C6 can control one chain of LED modules (within a chain, all modules show the same color/brightness). It offers four wireless protocols, but only one or two of them can be used at the same time.
- The extension module can control up to three chains of LED modules (each chain has individual color/brightness). Its ESP32 only has two wireless protocols, but they can be used at the same time, so that a total of three protocols can be combined.

I'm currently exploring a different approach, starting with LED Module C, which might need changes to the whole modularization concept. Stay tuned...

## State of the project
### Documentation
This readme is not up-to-date. Both software and hardware are already more advanced than what the next paragraphs describe. Please look at the source code and/or the LED Modules' READMEs in the `hardware` directory to get a better impression of the current state.

### Software
The firmware is currently in a transformation from messy, quick-and-dirty proof-of-concept to a more structured and reliable architecture. It supports all hardware components of the Main Module v1 and LED Module A.

Possible next steps:
 - Move code between bestelampe (hardware-dependent) and abstraktelampe (hardware-independent)
 - Make PWM fading, 20 bit resoluition and temporal dithering are available in Rust (only partly supported by esp-idf-hal)

### Hardware
For the hardware, multiple prototypes with various degrees of sophistication exist:

<img src="assets/first_prototype.jpg" width="49%" /><img src="assets/second_prototype.jpg" width="49%" />
<img src="assets/pcb_assembled.jpg" width="98%" />

I already ordered PCBs from JLCPCB for the Main Module v1, and even though they have [a lot of minor bugs](/hardware/mainmodule/README.md#Known-problems-for-v1), they look great and - even more important - are fully functional apart from the missing light sensor. **I do not recommend to order Main Module v1.** There are a lot of really easy-to-fix nuisances, so please wait for version 1.1 (see branch [`main-module-v1.1`](https://github.com/lenaschimmel/bestelampe/tree/main-module-v1.1)) or version 2. **If you really want a v1 board in your hands quickly, just contact me. I have a few spare ones (partly assembled).**

Some LED boards are also designed and have been manufactured.

I'm working on multiple enclosure designs, one based on a transparent flower pot, and one based on an existing lamp where I replace all the electronics with my own. Both contain many 3d-printed parts,  and a lot of manual labour to make them look *less 3d-printed*.

The next steps for the hardware could be:
 - Release Main Module v1.1
 - Put a second ESP32 into the prototype to test ESP-AT or similar communication between both ESPs
 - Create constant-current PWM driver for LED Board C.

 ## Price
 I've tried to estimate the prices for a complete lamp, but excluding the enclosure (because I have no idea how to estimate that). The calculation is based on ordering 100 PCBs per type, and some optimizations in Main Module v1.1, some of which are not yet done. 
 
 The two lamp configurations are:
 - **Simple:** 6 color channels (R,G,B,Warm White, Cold White, Amber). Needs the Main Module and 1 LED Module
 - **Extended:** 4*6 color channels (same colors as above, but control 4 groups independently). Needs the Main Module, Extension Module and 4 LED Modules. To drive all four groups at full brightness simultaneously, you'd need a bigger power supply.
